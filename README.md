# Social Media Site

## Project Summary

This project was from Codingphase.com, specifically the [**Learn HTML and CSS**](https://codingphase.com/courses/learn-html-and-css-by-building-a-cool-social-network/) course.  The first part of the course provided an introduction to HTML and CSS which was a great refresher.  The second half we were given a mockup of a social media site (can you guess which one?) and proceeded to breakdown the page section by section.

This was incredibly helpful to dissect each part of the page. After reviewing this part of the course, I decided to branch off on my own and style the page without the help from the video.

The course does not cover CSS Grid or Flexbox so I tried to not use either of those layout tools and instead stuck to traditional floats and lots of inline-block displays.  This was quite difficult and totally makes me appreciate the more advanced tools CSS offers today.

Although the page isn't pixel perfect, it was a great learning experience to build it from scratch.

## Technology and Tools Used
